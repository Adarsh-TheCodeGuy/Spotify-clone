Hello, this is a clone of spotify-web (but better).
To use it, clone this in your stystem and follow these steps
Create a folder named "songs" inside the folder where all your code is
Create another folder in the "songs" folder of a particular category. Example - "English songs" folder inside the "songs" folder
Put english songs in this folder.
Now add a png named "cover" in this folder. (Can be a png related to songs)
Add a info.json in this folder with this content -

title : "English songs",

Add as many folders you want and run the index.html and use your own spotify
